# WeatherAPP

This App it's a weather application that contains 4 city by default to provide information about the weather for the next 5 days.

I've been using https://openweathermap.org/ API to get the information and then display it.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
